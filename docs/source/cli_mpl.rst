opm-vis-mpl
===========

The alternative Matplotlib backend's command-line tool, drawing each cell as a flat quad instead
of real geometry. It is less developed than :doc:`cli_pv` and covers a smaller subset: one slice
at a time, wells only where they are completed on that slice, no glyphs, no thresholding or
clipping, and no whole-grid view. See
:doc:`cli` for the shared ``-f``/``--folder`` convention and 1-based ``-i``/``-j``/``-k`` indexing.

Each option group below has its own page with a description and a runnable example of every
option in it: :doc:`cli_mpl_input`, :doc:`cli_mpl_grid_only`, :doc:`cli_mpl_slicing`,
:doc:`cli_mpl_rstep_animation`, :doc:`cli_mpl_diff`, :doc:`cli_mpl_calculator`,
:doc:`cli_mpl_view`, :doc:`cli_mpl_wells`, :doc:`cli_mpl_fault`, :doc:`cli_mpl_polygons`,
:doc:`cli_mpl_output`. This backend supports a smaller option set than :doc:`cli_pv` - see its
option pages for glyphs, thresholding and clipping, none of which are available here.
