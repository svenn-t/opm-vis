    Validate the options of one opm-vis-pv run and render, animate or save its scene

    Parameters
    ----------
    plotter : pv.Plotter | None, optional
        Render window to draw into, by default None, which creates one of its own and closes
        it once show() returns. Pass an embedding widget to render into a GUI: the scene is
        then left on it rather than torn down, show() only re-renders it, and --window-size
        is ignored.

    Returns
    -------
    GridPlotter
        The plotter holding the finished scene, so a caller that passed its own render window
        can keep hold of it - to swap the report step or take a screenshot later without
        rebuilding the grid mesh, which is the expensive part

    Raises
    ------
    click.UsageError
        If the options do not make sense together; the message is meant to be shown as is, on
        a terminal or in a GUI's status bar alike.

    Notes
    -----
    Every parameter other than plotter is one of opm-vis-pv's own options, named exactly after
    it - see that command's --help for what each one does. Naming them identically is what
    lets main forward its parameters as a whole, and so what lets an option added to the
    command reach here without main being touched; tests/test_gui_parity.py checks that the
    two have not drifted apart.
