    Trajectories are full 3D paths through the grid, so unlike opm_vis.plot there is no need
    to truncate a well to the intersecting portion of a slice - slices only decides which
    wells are included, each still drawn in full.

    Wells are still assumed vertical, which is what opm_vis.utils.restart records: the i and j
    indices are the well head's and only the completed k indices vary.
