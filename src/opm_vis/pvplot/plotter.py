        Add vector glyphs (arrows) built from three keyword components

            OPM keyword giving the vector's x-component, e.g. "DISPX"
        y_keyword : str
            OPM keyword giving the vector's y-component, e.g. "DISPY"

            Restrict the glyphs to one i-, j- or k-slice, by default None, which places one
            glyph at every active cell of the whole grid
        slice_ind : int | None, optional
            Index of the slice; required together with slice_dim
        quads : bool, optional
            Place glyphs from cell-centre points alone instead of the full hexahedral mesh,
            by default False. Cheaper on a large grid, and never builds the full mesh at all -
            same idea as add_slice's own quads argument, but for a placement point rather than
            a face. Has no effect on where the arrows end up; see the Notes below.
        scale : bool, optional
            Scale each arrow by its own vector's magnitude, by default True. False draws
            every arrow the same length, showing only direction.
        factor : float | None, optional
            Factor the vectors are multiplied by before glyphing, by default None, which
            picks one that draws the largest vector at about the width of one grid cell.
        geom : pv.PolyData | None, optional
            Glyph shape, by default None, which draws PyVista's arrow
        every_n : int, optional
            Keep only 1 cell out of every this many, by default 1 (every cell gets a glyph).
            Thins out the arrows on a dense grid without changing their size; see the Notes
            below.
        name : str | None, optional
            Name to register the glyphs under, by default None, which uses the three
            keywords (and the slice, if one was given)
        kwargs : optional
            Optional arguments passed to pyvista.Plotter.add_mesh

        Returns
        -------
        str
            Name the glyphs were registered under

        Notes
        -----
        Physical vector fields (e.g. displacement, in metres) are usually many orders of
        magnitude smaller than the grid's own coordinates, which is why the vectors are scaled
        before glyphing rather than drawn at their literal length.

        The factor picked here - or passed explicitly - is reused by every later set_vectors
        call on this actor, so arrow length stays comparable across report steps rather than
        each frame being renormalised to fill the same space. Pass global_glyph_factor(...)
        explicitly if this report step's own largest vector is not representative of the
        whole run.

        every_n is applied after the factor is picked (or the peak magnitude is found, for an
        explicit factor), so thinning out the arrows never changes how big the ones that
        remain are - only how many of them there are. every_n=1 skips the thinning code
        entirely, so a full-density plot pays no cost for the option's existence.

        quads only changes how a placement point is obtained, not the arrows themselves: a
        glyph only ever needs one point per cell, never that cell's actual volume, so skipping
        the full hexahedral build (and, on a slice, touching only that slice's cells) changes
        nothing about what gets drawn. The one real difference is on a slice: quads places the
        point at the slice face GridSlice3D already exposes, which sits exactly on a
        quads=True add_slice's surface, whereas the default places it at the cell's true
        volumetric centre - inside a solid add_slice actor if that one is not also using
        quads, and invisible there as a result.

        Glyph actors take no part in set_scalars: an arrow's points carry per-glyph, not
        per-cell, data, so there is no ACTIVE_INDEX left to write scalar values through.
        Coloured by magnitude (scalars="GlyphScale") by default, with its own colour bar
        alongside any set_scalars one; pass color=... for a flat colour instead, which leaves
        both the magnitude colouring and its bar out entirely. PyVista colours by scalars
        whenever they are given regardless of a color also being passed, so a caller-given
        color always takes priority here rather than being silently overridden by the
        magnitude colouring.

        Notes
        -----
        Values are written into the datasets already on screen and the scene is re-rendered.
        Nothing is rebuilt or re-added, which is what makes stepping through report steps
        cheap; opm_vis.plot instead creates a fresh artist per frame and never clears the old
        ones.

        Each dataset is indexed through its own ACTIVE_INDEX array, so slices, the full grid
        and thresholded subsets can all be coloured from one read of the file.

        Every dataset gets the same colour limits, so a single scalar bar is valid for all of
        them. opm_vis.plot has to warn that its colorbar only describes the first slice.

        calc_kind and diff_rstep combine as "diff first, then aggregate": the per-cell
        difference between rstep and diff_rstep is computed first, across every layer the
        calculator spans, and calc_kind aggregates that difference field - "the mean/sum of how
        much each cell changed between these two report steps", not the difference between the
        two report steps' own means/sums. Only the cells of the slice_dim/slice_ind slice are
        touched by the aggregate; every other dataset on screen keeps its plain values.

        calc_kind="surface" does not aggregate at all: the dataset added for that slice by
        add_slice(surface=True) already carries each lateral position's first active cell's own
        ACTIVE_INDEX, so this method's plain, non-aggregating branch below - the same one used
        with no --calculator - already colours it correctly, diff included.

        Notes
        -----
        Axis titles carry the case's own length unit, so a field-units case is labelled in
        feet. opm_vis.plot hard-codes metres whatever the case uses.

        The z-axis is labelled with depth increasing downwards, matching OPM's own
        convention, even though the mesh's actual z coordinate points up (see
        mesh._read_corners): the tick values shown are the negative of the geometry's own z,
        via show_bounds' axes_ranges, rather than the mesh's z coordinate itself. Passing an
        explicit `axes_ranges` (or `bounds`/`mesh`) overrides this.

        Call this after choosing the view. In a 2D view the axis pointing at the camera is
        left out, because drawing it would put a meaningless third axis - and its tick labels -
        across the middle of the picture; the bounding box has no way of knowing it is being
        looked at end-on. That decision is made here, from whichever view is current, so
        changing the view afterwards means calling this again.

        One limitation remains in the 2D cross-sections: VTK draws no ticks along the depth
        axis when it is looked at edge-on, so those views get a horizontal scale but no vertical
        one. The mesh geometry is unaffected.

        A metric case additionally gets its own x-/y-/z-axis switched from metres to km,
        independently of the other two, once that axis' own span exceeds _KM_AXIS_SPAN_M - a
        wide field is easier to read in km, while a shallow depth range usually is not. This
        only changes the tick labels (and the axis title's unit); the mesh geometry is
        unaffected, same as the z-axis sign flip above. Passing an explicit `axes_ranges`
        opts out of this, same as it opts out of the z-axis sign flip.

        rsteps : Sequence[int] | None, optional
            Report steps to animate, by default None, which uses every report step

            Redraw wells each frame, by default False. Worth turning on when wells open or shut
            during the period being animated.

            Restrict wells to those with a completion on at least one of these (dim, index)

            is True.
        vectors : bool, optional
            Update every glyph actor each frame, by default False. Requires add_glyphs to have
            been called first; its scale factor is left untouched, so pass factor or
            global_glyph_factor(...) there if arrow length should stay comparable throughout.

            Animate the difference from this (fixed) report step instead of keyword's own
            values, by default None (the values themselves). rstep still varies frame to
            frame; diff_rstep is the one report step every frame is differenced against.
        diff_kind : str, optional
            See set_scalars; only used when diff_rstep is given, by default "plain"

        Each frame only writes new values into the datasets already on screen, so the geometry
        is built once for the whole animation. Colour limits are computed once up front rather
        than per frame, which is what keeps a frame's colours meaningful next to its
        neighbours'.

        Playing (filename=None) needs an actual on-screen window, so construct the plotter
        with off_screen=False (the default) in that case - there is nothing to show
        interactively otherwise.

        Notes
        -----
        The characteristic length is derived from the source mesh's own bounding diagonal and
        cell count, so it is correct whether source is the whole grid or one of its slices,
        without needing to know how many cells span each axis.

        When scale is True, an arrow's length is its vector's magnitude times factor, so the
        peak magnitude has to be divided out to land near the characteristic length. When
        scale is False every arrow is drawn at the same length regardless of magnitude, so the
        factor alone sets that length and dividing by peak_magnitude would blow it up instead
        (a real displacement field is commonly five or six orders of magnitude smaller than
        the grid's own coordinates).

        glyph() is typed generically over every PyVista dataset, so its declared return type
        is wider than what it can actually produce here; the cast reflects that narrower,
        verified invariant, matching the same pattern used for extract_cells/clean/threshold/
        clip elsewhere in this module.
