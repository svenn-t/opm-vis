        Cell data comes along, so the extracted mesh keeps its own ACTIVE_INDEX array and can
        be given property values without consulting the parent mesh.

        If the whole-grid mesh has already been built (e.g. add_grid() was also called, or
        this is a second slice), its corners are already in memory and reused here via
        extract_cells() - cheap, and avoids reading the file twice for the same cells.
        Otherwise, only this slice's own cells are read from the file at all: the whole grid
        is never built just to throw most of it away, unlike going through .mesh would.

        extract_cells() is typed generically over every PyVista dataset, so its declared
        return type is wider than what it can actually produce from a mesh that is already an
        UnstructuredGrid. The cast below reflects that narrower, verified invariant rather than
        working around a real ambiguity.

        than materialising every hexahedron in the model. The cost is that a quad has no
        volume, so thresholding, clipping and volume rendering need extract_slice instead.

        coordinates, where float32 would resolve a northing of ~6.7e6 m to only half a metre
        and break exact-match point welding.

        OPM reports z as depth, increasing downwards, but VTK's own convention (and every
        camera pyvista sets up) assumes z points up. Negating z here, once, is what lets the

        Shared by _build() (every active cell) and extract_slice()'s own fast path (one
        slice's cells only), so welding/cell-array bookkeeping stays identical either way.

        Welding merges the coincident corner points that neighbouring cells share, cutting
        the point count by roughly a factor of eight. The tolerance is exactly zero on
        purpose: corner-point grids are genuinely discontinuous across faults, and only
        bit-identical coordinates should ever be merged. Cell order is unaffected.

        Uses the sign of the scalar triple product of the i-, j- and k-edge vectors leaving
        corner 0, which is the signed volume of the cell taken as a parallelepiped. That sign
        is positive exactly when _VTK_HEX_ORDER yields outward-facing hexahedra, verified
        against a standard OPM grid with corners already carrying pvplot's z, which points up
        (see _read_corners), rather than OPM's own depth-positive-down z.

        A majority vote over all cells is used so that degenerate, zero-volume cells cannot
        decide the answer on their own.
