    list[int]
        One active index per lateral position that has at least one active layer in

        no active layer anywhere in the range is omitted entirely, same convention as
        slice_active_indices.

    Notes
    -----
    Cheap: only active_index() lookups, no per-cell corner reads. This is what lets
    --calculator surface show "the first active cell from -i/-j/-k onwards" even at lateral
    positions where -i/-j/-k's own layer is inactive: unlike slice_layer_grid, which is pinned
    to one layer, the active index returned for a position here can come from anywhere in the
    range - it is not necessarily on start_ind's own layer. Callers that build a slice's
    geometry from this get a "draped" surface: each cell keeps its own real position, which can
    vary in depth from one lateral position to the next.

    slice_active_indices(egrid, slice_dim, slice_ind) is exactly the single-layer case of this
    (start_ind == end_ind == slice_ind) - see its own, thinner wrapper below.
