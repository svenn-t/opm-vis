        x_axis : str, optional
            One of X_AXES, by default "date"
        subplots : bool, optional
            Whether to give each keyword its own subplot instead of drawing them all in one
            axes, by default False
        layout : tuple[int, int] | None, optional
            Explicit (rows, cols) for the subplot grid, by default None. Only used with
            subplots.
        log_y : bool, optional
            Whether to use a logarithmic y axis, by default False
        xlim : tuple[Any, Any] | None, optional
            X axis limits, by default None (the span of the data). Datetimes with x_axis
            "date", numbers otherwise.
        ylim : tuple[float, float] | None, optional
            Y axis limits, by default None (the range of the data)
        title : str | None, optional
            Figure title, by default None, which names the case when there is only one
        grid : bool, optional
            Whether to draw grid lines, by default True
        legend : bool, optional
            Whether to label the curves, by default True
        linewidth : float | None, optional
            Line width of every curve, by default None, which keeps Matplotlib's own default
        linestyle : str | Sequence[str] | None, optional
            One of LINE_STYLES, applied to every keyword; or one per keyword, in the same
            order as `keywords`. By default None, which draws a solid line - or, with several
            keywords sharing one axes under --compare, the per-keyword dash pattern that tells
            them apart from one case to the next. Given together with marker for a keyword,
            both are drawn; given alone with marker, it defaults to "none" for that keyword so
            the marker replaces the line instead of joining it.
        marker : str | Sequence[str] | None, optional
            Matplotlib marker for every data point (e.g. "o", "s", "^"), applied to every
            keyword or one per keyword, in the same order as `keywords`. By default None (no
            marker). See Matplotlib's marker reference for the full set.
        color : str | Sequence[str] | None, optional
            Matplotlib colour (name, hex code, "C0"/"C1"/...) for every curve, applied to every
            keyword or one per keyword, in the same order as `keywords`. By default None, which
            keeps the computed colour - one per keyword normally, or one per case under
            --compare, where an explicit colour here then applies to every case sharing that
            keyword, and only the legend still tells the cases apart.
