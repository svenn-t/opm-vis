# return a prefix with no extension. The CLIs take the folder instead (-f/--folder), which the
# *_dir fixtures return.

    SPE1CASE1 is a fully active, standard-oriented 10x10x3 Cartesian box grid in field units,

    at (527495.5, 6771119.0). Useful only for exercising the MAPAXES transform itself, not for
    anything that reads simulation results.
